It is a respiratory infection caused by a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread throughout China and around the world since its first outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
Covid-19 is transmitted when droplets of an infected person penetrate the respiratory tract or mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth.
If infected, respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and pneumonia appear as the main symptoms after an incubation period of about 2 to 14 days, but the frequency of asymptomatic infection cases is also high.
